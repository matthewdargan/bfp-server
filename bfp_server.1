.SH NAME
bfp_server \- Basic File Protocol Server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bfp_server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bfp_server
serves Basic File Protocol (BFP) content to clients.

BFP is a file-sharing protocol that enables users to host files on
POSIX-compliant systems and access files on remote servers. BFP operates over
TCP/IP, using port 8039 as the designated BFP port.

Clients can request directories and files after connecting to a BFP server with
a valid IP address and port. The server's responses are as follows:

If an invalid directory or file path is requested, the server responds with a
null character (NUL) to indicate the request's invalidity.

If a valid directory is requested, the server responds with the directory
information, including subdirectories and filenames, making it easy for clients
to navigate and explore the available files.

If a valid file path is requested, the server responds with the data of the
requested file.
